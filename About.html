    Tourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel.[1] UN Tourism defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one<br> consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business<br> and other purposes".[2] Tourism can be domestic (within the <br>traveller's own country) or international, <br>and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.</h6>
